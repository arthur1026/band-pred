Estimating available bandwidth on ultra-high speed networks is an important yet
not well-solved problem~\cite{yin2014}. Noises coming from burst cross traffic
and severe interrupt coalescence could distort probe streams. Most established
methods handle buffering-related noises well only on low speed networks (100Mbps
or lower).

Instead of using hand-designed mechanisms, we consider using modern machine
learning approaches to automatically discover underlying patterns of such
noises, thus providing an alternative way of predicting available bandwidth on
ultra-high speed networks. Time permitting, we would like to explore different
machine learning techniques. For example, linear regression methods like
Lasso~\cite{Tibshirani1996}, deep neural networks, etc.
