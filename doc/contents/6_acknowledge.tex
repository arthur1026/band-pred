\label{sec:future_work}
Many probing packages are lost, and we discarded all in-complete probing
sequences. One interesting problem is how we can take advantages of such
partial information to infer available bandwidth. We believed that the high
dimensional sequences actually lay on a much lower dimensional manifold, such
partial sequence may convey enough information to do the regression. We can use
techniques like compressed sensing\cite{donoho2006compressed} to do such inference.
