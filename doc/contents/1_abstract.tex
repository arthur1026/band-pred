Although existing bandwidth estimation algorithms generally work well on normal 100Mbps networks, they do not adapt well to ultra-high speed networks.
This is due to that finer inter-packet gaps are more vulnerable to buferring-related noises, where fine gaps are needed for high rate probing sequences.
Recently,~\cite{Yin2014} has proposed a smoothing strategy, Buffering-aware Spike Smoothing (BASS), which helps significantly in scaling bandwidth estimation to ultra-high speed networks.
Encouraged by our instincts on machine learning techniques, we formulate this bandwidth estimation problem as a regression problem between the sending/receiving gaps and true bandwidth.
We proposed a full pipeline consisting of raw data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and model evaluation.
We have experimentally shown that our methods reduce the average error rate from 6.97\% to 1.82\% when comparing against the state-of-art~\cite{Yin2014} using the same dataset.
