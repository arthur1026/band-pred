Although existing bandwidth estimation algorithms generally work well on normal
100~Mbps networks, they do not adapt well to ultra-high speed networks. This is
due to that finer inter-packet gaps are more vulnerable to buffering-related
noises, where fine gaps are needed for high rate probing sequences.
Recently,~\cite{Yin2014} has proposed a smoothing strategy, Buffering-aware
Spike Smoothing (BASS), which helps significantly in scaling bandwidth
estimation to ultra-high speed networks. Encouraged by our instincts on machine
learning techniques, we formulate this bandwidth estimation problem as a
regression problem, which predicts the available bandwidth based on probing
stream statistics. For this project, we proposed and implemented a full
pipeline consisting stages of raw data preprocessing, feature engineering,
model training and model evaluation. Preliminary experimental results showed an
average error rate reduce from 6.97\% to 1.82\% compared to the
state-of-art~\cite{Yin2014}.
