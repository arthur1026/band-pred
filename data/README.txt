1. ground truth file
column1: probe stream id
column2: ground truth available bandwidth
column3: total bytes of cross traffic( which should not interest u).

2. probe stream file
pay attention to pid, sendgap, rcvtsgap only

3. estimation error file
column1: probe stream id
column2: available bandwidth calculated with our algorithm
column3: ground truth avail-bw
column4: relative estimation error
